# Comet_Planning

 A drag-and-drop interface to help UTD students plan out their 4-year coursework.

## Getting Started

Stable release: checkout [master](https://github.com/acmutd/comet_planning/tree/master)

Developer version: checkout [dev](https://github.com/acmutd/comet_planning/tree/dev)

## How to Contribute

There will be three branches that we will be utilizing: the master branch, the dev branch, and branches for particular features. Below are the step by step process we will use as a team.

1. From `dev`, create a new feature branch. For example, `auth-signin`
2. Make commits to the feature branch.
3. When enough of the feature is complete, open a pull request to merge changes from your feature branch to `dev`. For larger features or changes to code, open a draft pull request to track changes until completion.
4. Request a review from a project contributor, and add the pull request to a project board and milestone (if applicable)
5. When a review is complete, a contributor will squash merge the feature branch into `dev`. The feature branch can then be deleted.
